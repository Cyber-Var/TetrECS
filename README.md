## Description

The user has a game field with limited spaces. Tiles of different shapes appear on the screen. The player has limited time to place the tile on the field. 
The player has three lives. A life is lost whenever a current tile cannot be placed on the field as there are no spaces. When all three lives are lost, the game is over.
